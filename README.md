# 🍩 DonutBet.cc — Source Analysis & Transparency Repository

> **Status:** Permanently banned after significant winnings  
> **Reason given:** None / vague  
> **Outcome:** Account closed after winning too consistently

---

## 📌 Overview

This repository documents the **client-side behavior, data structures, and observed game logic** of **DonutBet.cc**, a gambling platform that banned my account following an unusually large win streak.

After the ban, I preserved and organized everything I had already collected while interacting with the site — including serialized responses, hashes, payload formats, and gameplay state behavior.

This project exists for **transparency, education, and technical analysis**.

---

## 🧠 Why This Exists

I was **not**:
- Exploiting vulnerabilities  
- Using bots or automation  
- Modifying traffic or requests  

I simply:
- Played normally  
- Identified patterns  
- Won consistently  
- Was banned  

Instead of going back and forth with support, I chose to **document the system**.

## 🔍 What You’ll Find Here

- Client-side game logic snapshots  
- Serialized game state examples  
- Hashes, salts, and payload structures  
- Notes on deterministic or repeatable behavior  
- Observations on fairness & randomness claims  
- Reproducible examples where applicable  

> ⚠️ **Important:**  
> This repository does **not** contain active exploits or step-by-step abuse instructions.  
> It documents *observed behavior*, not *how to cheat*.

## 🧩 Final Notes

If you operate a gambling platform:
- Don’t ban players for winning  
- Don’t claim *provably fair* without accountability  
- Don’t rely on obscurity as security  

If you’re a player:
- Always assume the house is watching  
- Winning consistently is often riskier than losing
